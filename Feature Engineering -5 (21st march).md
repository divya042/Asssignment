Q1.What is the difference between ordinal Encoding and label Encoding? Provide an example of when you 
might choose one over the other?
Ans-
   Ordinal Encoding and label Encoding are two commonly used methods for encoding categorical data.
    
Ordinal Encoding is a method of encoding categorical data where each unique value in the datasetis assigned a numerical

Label encoding on the other hand ,is a method of encoding categorical data where   each unique value in the dataset is a 

when to choose one over the other depends on the specific characteritics of the dataset and the prblemat hand .

Lbel encoding , on the other and ,is preferred when there is a no natural ordering to the categories and each category

Q2.Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in 
a machine learning project?
Ans-
   Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a method of encoding categorical variables where the numerical values assigned to

The steps involved in Target Guided Ordinal Encoding are:
    
1.Calculate the mean of the target variable foe each category in the categorical variable.

2.Order the categories basede on their mean value,with the category having the lowest mean assigned the lowest numerical 

3.Replace the categorical values in the dataset with the numerical values assigned in step 2.

For example, consider a dataset containing a categorical variables "city"with categories"New York","Los Angeles"and "chicago"

1.New York:mean sales: = $100,000
2.Los Angeles:mean sales = $75,000
3.Chicago: $50,000

we would then assign the numerical values based on the order of the means:

1.New York:3
2.Los Angeles:2
3.Chicago:1

Finally,we would replace the categorical valus in the dataset with the numerical values assigned in step 3.

Target Guided Encoding can be useful ina amchine learning project when there is a clear relationship between them

Q3.Explain covarience and exaplain why it us  important in statistical analysis .How is covariance calculated?
Ans-
   covariance is a statistical measure that quantities the degree to which two random variables are linearly realted.

In statistical analysis,covariance is an important concept beacuse it helps us understand the realtionship between two random variables

Covariance is calculated as the everage of the product of the deviations of each variable from their respecively 

cov(X,Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]

where E[X] and E[Y] are the expected valus (means) of X and Y, respectively.

If the covariance between two variables is positive ,it means that the two variables tend to move in the same direction

covariance is an imporatant concept in statistical because it is used to calculate other important statistical measures

Q4.For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color(red,green,blue),size(small,medum,
  large), and Material(wood,metal,plastic),perform label encoding using python's scikit-learn library.
show your code and exaplain the output.
Ans-
    To perform label encoding for the given categorical variables using scikit-learn library in python , we can use the 
    
from sklearn.preprocessing import LbelEncoder
import pandas as pd

# creating a sample dataframe
df = pd.DataFrame({['color':['red','green','blue','red','blue'],
                   'size':['medium','small','large','medium','medium'],
                   'Material':['wood','metal','plastic','metal']})
                    
# creating an instance of the LabelEncoder class
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
                
# encoding the categorical variables in the dataframe
df['color'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['color'])
df['size'] = label_encoder.fi_transform(df['size'])
df['Material'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(df['Material'])
                    
print(df)
                    
output:
         color      size        Material
                
0        2           1           2
1        1           0           0
2        0           2           1
3        2           1           1
4        0           1           0
                    
In the above code, we first create a simple dataframe with three categorical variables = color ,size and material
                    
The fit_transform()method of the LabelEncoder class is used to both fit the encoder to the unique categories in the variable

The output shows the resulting encoded dataframe, where each unique category in each categorical variable is mapped to

```python
Q5. To calculate the covariance matrix for the given variables in a dataset (Age,Income,and Education level ),


import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# creating a sample dataset 
data = {'Age':[20,25,30,35,40],
        'Income':[30000,40000,50000,60000,70000],
        'Education':[12,14,16,18,20]}

df = nd.DataFrame(data)

# calculating the covariance matrix
cov_matrix = np.cov(df.T)

print(cov_matrix)

output:
    
[[62.5e+00  2.5e+04   2.5e+00]
 [2.5e+04   1.0e+09   1.0e+05]
 [2.5e+00   1.0e+05   1.0e+01]]

In the above code, we first create a sample dataset with three variabls -Age ,Income and Education level

The resulting covariance matrix shows the covariance between the variables.The diagonl elements of matrix 

Interpreting the results, we can see the covariance between Age, Income is positive and relatively large(2.5e+04
                                                                                                         
However ,It is important to note that the covariance values are dependent o the units of measurement of the variabls

```python
Q6.You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical
variables including "Gender"(male/female),"Education Level"(High school/Bachelor's/Master's/phD),
and "Employment Status"(Unemployment/part-timeFull-time).Which encoding would you use for 
each variable and why?
Ans-
   For categorical variables in machine learning models,we typically use encoding techniques to convert them into number
    
     Here are some encoding methods that can be used for each of the given variables:
            
Gender: 
since gender is a binary categorical variable with inly two possible values(Male/Female) , we can use binary encoding

Educatio Level:
For education level,we can use one-hot encoding creates new columns for each unique  value of the variable

Employment status:
For employment status,we can use ordinal encoding, ordinal encoding assigns a numerical value to each unique value 

In summery , we can use binary encoding for gender, one-hot encoding level, and ordinal encoding for employment
            
```


```python
q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables,"Temperature" and "Humidity" and two
categorical variables, "weather Condition" (sunny/cloudy/Rainy) and "Wind Direction" (North/south
East/West).Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.
Ans-
   To calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and E[X] and E[Y]  are the expected values of X AND Y , respctvely
    
cov(X,Y) =  E[(X - E[X](Y - E[Y])]
               
where X  and Y  are two random variables and E[Y] nd E[Y] are the expected of X and Y , respectively.
               
For the given dataset with two continuous variables (Temperature and Humidiy) and two  categorical variables 
               
Assuming you have a simple of n observations , you can xalculate the simple covariance between Temperature(X) and Humidity(Y)
               
cov(X,Y) = [(Xi - mean(X))(Yi - mean(Y))] / (n-1)
               
where Xi and Yi are the values of Temperature and Humidity resp.   in it observation and mean(X)and mean (Y)
            
To interpret the results , you can look at the sign of the covariance . a positive covariance means that as one variable
               
However ,it's important to note that the covariance only measures only direction and strength of the linear realtionship.
