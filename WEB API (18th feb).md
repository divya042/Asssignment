Q1.What is an web API ? G ive an example , where an API is used in real life.

Ans - An API , or Application programming Interface, is a st of protocols , routines and tools for building software application
An example, - An API in real life is the Google Maps API.The Google Maps API provides a way for developers to embed  google
Developers can use the API to access a wide range of features and functionality , such as displaying maps and satellite

Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API.
Ans - 
     Advantages of uing API:
1. Reusability: APIs provide a reusable interface to software function or services , which can be used across different

2.Flexibility: APIS provide a flexible way to integegrate different software applicatios, making it easier to create custom

3. Scalability: APIs  can handle large amount of data and traffice , making them ideal for use in large scale system

4.Improved efficiency: APIs can help aautomate repetative taks and atreamline workflows , which can improve the efficiency

5.Increased Innovation: APIs can stimulate innovation by allowing developers to bulid on existing software and services
 
     Disadvantages of using API:
            
1.Security risks: APIs can be a security risk if they are not designed and implemente properly. They can provide 

2. Complexity: APIs can be complex to design and implement , especially when integrating with legacy system or non standard 

3. Dependence on Third party services: APIs are often depedenton Third-party services,ewhich can cause issues

4.Maintenance and support:APIs require ongoing maintaince and support , which can be time-consuming and expensive

5. Compatibility issues: APIs may have compatibility issues with different platforms,programming language or versions

Q3. What is a web Api ? Differentiate between API and web API.
Ans - 
     A web API , also known as web services, is an API that is accessed over the HTTP protocol and allows different software
    API , on the other hand ,is a more general term that refers to any interface that allows different software systems to 
    
    An summary, a web API is a specify type of API  that is accessed over the internet using the HTTP protocol.

Q4. Explain Rest and SOAP Architecture. Mension shortcomings of soap.
Ans - 
    REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)  are two widely used architectural

    REST is a lightweight and flexible architectural style that relies on a set of principles and constrains for creatig 
    
    SOAP , on the other hand , is a more complex and rigid architectural  style that relies on XML- based messaging protocols
    
    The shortcomings of SOAP architecture include its complexity , verbosity and overhead . SOAP messages  are typically much
```


```python
Q5. Differenciate between SOAP and REST .
Ans - 

1. Architecture style :REST ( Representional State Transfer) is a software architeture style thatbuses a  client - server 
 
2. Data format: REST ues a lightwaeight data  formats like JSON (JvaScript object Notation ) or XML (Extensible Marup Language)

3.URL Structure: REAT has a more intuitive and user - friendly URL struture that maps to resources , While SOAP uses a mo

4. State Management: REST is stateless , meaning it diesn't require any client context to be  stored on the server. SOAP

5. Performance: REST is generally faster and more efficient that bSOAP because it uses a smaller message sixe and has less 

6. Security: SOAP has bulitb-in security features, While REST  relies on transport - level security like SSL ( Security Sockets Lnguage)

Overall , REST is simpler and more flexible than SOAP , making it a popular choice for buliding web services.
