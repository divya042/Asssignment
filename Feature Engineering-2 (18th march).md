Q1.What is the filter method in feature se;lection, and how does it work?
Ans-
  The feature method is a selction method technique that selects features based on their individuals statical proper 

The filter method works by ranking the features according to statical metric and selecting a subset of features 

For example, in a classification problem , we can use the coefficient to meatures the strength of the linear

overall , the filter method is a  simple and efficient technique for feature selection that help reduce the dimension

Q2.How does the wrapper method differ from the filter method in feature selection?
Ans-
    The Wrapper method for feature selection differs from    the filter method in that it selectes features based on thir
    
The wrapper method works by using a search algorithm to evaluate different subsets of features and testing each subset

one common example of the wrapper method is the Recursive Feature Elimination(RFE) algorithm,which strts with all

compared to the filter method,the wrapper method can be more computationally expensive since it involves training 



```python
Q3.What are some common techniques used in Embeded features selection methods?
Ans-
   Embeded feature selection methods are techniqes that preform features selection as part of the model  training process
    
1.Regularization:Regularization techniques , such as Lasso or Ridge regression , penalize the magnitude of the coefficient

2.Tree-based methods: Decision trees,random forests and gradient boosting algorithms can be used to identify the most features

3.Neural Networks: Neural networks can be used to identify the most features by using techniques such as weight

4.Support Vector Mchines: Support vector Mchines can be use different types of kernels to fit data in high-dimensional features

Q4.What are some drawbacks of using the filter method for feature selection?
Ans- 
    some drawbacks of using the filter method for features selection include:
    
1.The filetr method does not consider the interactions between features .It evaluates each feature independentaly 

2.The filter method does not based on the performance of a specific model .It relies solely on statistical metrics to evaluate

3.The filter method may not be suitable for high dimensional datasets,where the number of features is much larger than

Q5.In which situations would you prefer using the filter method  the wrapper method for features
selection?
Ans-
   The Filter method is generally preferred over the wrapper in the following situations:
    
1.Large datasets:The Filter method is computationally less expensive than the wrapper method ,making it suitable for 

2.Quick and efficient feature selection: The Filter metod is faster and easier to implement than the wrapper method .

3.Model.agnostic feature selection : The filter method is model-agnoistic, meaning it can be used with any machine learning

4.preprosessing steps: The filter method can also be used as a preprocesssing step before using the wrapper method.

Q6.In a telecom company, you are working on a a project to develop a predictive model for customer churn.
you are unsure of which features to include in the model beacuse the dataset contains several different 
ones.Describe how you would choose the most pertinent attribute for the model using the filter method.
Ans-
    To choose the most pertinent attributes for the model using the Filter method ,we would typically follow these steps

1.calculate the correlation between each feature and the target variable (in these case ,customer churn).

2.select the top feature based on their correlation with the target variable .Typically , we would select a predetermined

3.Remove any redundant features(i.e. ,features that are highly correlated with each other)from the selected features.

In the case of a telecom company trying to develop a predictive model for customer churn,we would start by calculating

Q7.You are working on a project to predict the outcome of a soccer match .You have a large dataset wit
many features ,including player statistics and team rankings. Explain how would use the Embeded 
method to select the most relevant features for the model.
Ans-
  The Embeded method for feature selection combines feature selection with the model training process.It works by EmDDED method
    
In the case of predicting the outcome of a soccer match, we would use a ,machine learning algorithm such as logistic regression

For example, in logistic regression we would examine the magnitude and sign if the coefficients for each feature 

In random forest ,we would use the feature us to simultaneously train the model and select the most important features.

Q8.You are working on a project to predict the price of  a house based on its features , such as size ,location,
and age,you have a limited number of features and you want to ensure that you select the most important
ones for the model .Explain how you would use the wrapper method to select the best set of features for the 
predictor.
Ans-
    To use the wrapper method for feature selection in the given scenario , you can follow these steps:
    
1.Choose a set of features to start with.
2.Train a model using only those features and evaluate it performance using a cross-validation technique.
3.Remove or add a features to the current set and train new model.
4.Evaluate the new model's performance and compare t to the previous model.
5.Repeat steps 3-4 for all possible combinations of features.
6.Select the set of features that gives the best model performace.

This process can be computationally expensive as it requires training and evluating multiple models.

In the case of predicting house prices , you could with a set of features such as size, loactions,age .
