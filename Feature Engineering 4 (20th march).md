Q1.What is the data encoding? How is it useful in data science? 
Ans-
   Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format to another , Iy is used to transform the data so that data can
be supported .

There are several type of encoding techniques used in data science, including:
    
    1.Binary encoding: This involves converting categorical variables into binary variables (0 or 1) to make them machine-reading
    
    2.One-hot encoding: This is a type of binary encoding that converts each category in a variable into a binary variable
    
    3.Label encoding: This involves assigning a unique integer value to each category in a variable,with the values ranging
    
    4.Ordinal encoding: This is similar to label encoding, but the integer values are assigned based on the order
    
Data encoding is useful in data science because it allows data to be processed efficiently by algorithms,as different

Q2.What is nominal encoding? Provide an eaxample of how you would use it ina real -world scenario.
Ans-
    Nominal encoding is a type of categorical encoding in which each category in a avraible is assigned a unique integer 
    
A real-world example of nominal encoding would be in customer segmentaion for a retail company.Let's say the retailcustomer

To use nominal encoding for this variable,we would assign each category a unique integer value .Lets say assign the value

Customer ID       Mode of shopping
    1                 0
    2                 0
    3                 1
    4                 1
    
    This encoding allows us to process the data using machine learning algorithm , which typically numeric inputs.
    
    overall , nominal encoding is a useful technique for encoding vriables that do not have any inherent order

Q3.In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding ? provide a practical example.
Ans-
   Nominal encoding and one-hot encoding are two common techniques used for encoding categorical variables indata science
    
Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding when:
    
    1.The categorical variables has many categories: One-hot encoding can result in a large number of features, making the data
    
    2.The categorical variable has low cardinality: One-hot encoding can be more suitable for categorical variable 
    
    3.The encoding does not need to capture relationship between categories:Nominal wncoding does not preserve the realationship
    
    
    A practical example of when nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding is in sentiment analysis of product rev

Q4. Suppose you have a dataset containing categorical data with 5 unique values .ehich encoding
techniques would you use to transform this data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithms?
Explain why you made this choice.
Ans-
   The choice of encoding technique categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithm
    
Nominal encoding assign each category in a variable a unique integer value , which makes it a suitable encoding techniques

Overall , given the nature of the categorical data with only 5 unique and the lack of any natural order or ranking

Q5.In a machine learning project , you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns.Two of the columns
are categorical and the remaining three columns are numerical .If you were to use nominal encoding to 
transform the categorical data how many new columns would be cared ? show your calculations.
Ans-
   If we use nominal encoidng to transform the two categorical columns in the dataset , we would create two new columns
    
For eac unique value in ecah categirical column , we woulf assign a unique integer value.If the first categorical coumn

Ech new column would represent one o the unique values in the categorical variable and would have a value if 1 

so, in this case ,if we use nominal encoding to transform the two categorical columns in the dataset , we would create

Q6.You are working with a dataset containing infpormation about types of animals , including their
species, habits and diet.which encoding technique would you use to transform the categorical data into a format suitable for 
machine learning algorithm? Justify your answer.
Ans-
   The choice of encoding technique to transform categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning algorithm

Nominal encoding would be useful for variables such as "species" and "habitat" as they do not have any natural order 

On the other hand , one-hot encoding would be useful for variables such as"diet" where there may be multiple categories

By using a combination of nominal and one-hot encoding , we would be able to capture the important information from all

Q7.You are working on a project that involves predicting customer churn for telecommunications
cpmapny .You have a dataset with 5 features ,including the customer's gender , age , contract type,
data into numerical data? provide a step-by-step explanation of how you would implement the encoding.
Ans-
   In this case,we have only one categorical variable - the "contract type " feature - and four numerical variables.
    
Here is a step-by-step exaplanationof how we would implement the encoding:
    
1. First , we would identify the unique values of the "contarct type" feature in the dataset, suppose we have three unique

2.Next , we would assign each unique value a unique integer value. we couldbuse a simple ,mapping , such as 1 for "month

3.We would create a new column in the dataset to represent the encoded "contract type" feature and populate it 

4. Finally , we would use the transformed datasetin our machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn .

For the remining numerical features , we would not need to prfoem any encoding , However we may need to perform addition
